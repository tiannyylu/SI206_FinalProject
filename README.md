# Tianny Lu SI 206 Final Project
This is my final project for SI 206 at the University of Michigan School of Information. This program searches through a list of album ID numbers and pulls data from the Spotify API. The specific objects are pulled from the results and stored into a database. The data that is needed to pulled from the database and manipulated. The results are outputted in a CSV file and shown in a visualization.

## Getting Started
Ensure that a spotify_info.py file is contained within the same directory and run the file final_project.py

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
Modules to install include: requests, spotipy, sqlite3, matplotlib
It is important to also have a spotify_info.py file containing confidential information for a Spotify Developer account.

```

### Files Included
```
- final_project.py (Contains the Python program)
- spotify_info.py (Spotify Developer information needs to be added)
- avgLengths.csv (Contains the calculated output)
- albums.sqlite (Contains the database)
```

## Why This Project?
I wanted to create a project where I was able to practice everything I have learned in the Fall semester and I wanted to use an API from something I use daily. I'm interested in how to manipulate data and how to best visualize what the data is telling us.
